# TemperatureLogger

For now this is a relatively simple project. It expects the PATH is set up with the selenium chromedriver, and a google chrome copy is in the folder with it. 
I am unsure as to whether this project works on windows, if anyone wants to they can pull the code and make it work. 

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Maokus/TemperatureLogger.git
cd TemperatureLogger
```

## Running
`python3 driver.py`
